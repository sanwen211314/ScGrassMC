# Scaled gradients on Grassmann manifolds for matrix completion

This code implements gradient methods for matrix completion based on the scaled gradients on Grassmann manifolds proposed in:

Thanh Ngo and Yousef Saad, *Scaled gradient on Grassmann manifold for matrix completion,*, NIPS 2012

## How to run

- Run compile_mex.m first to compile some mex routines
- Run test.m to compare ScGrassMC and GROUSE
